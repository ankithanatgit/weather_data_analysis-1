# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing temperature patterns across different locations to identify the hottest and coldest regions based on their mean temperatures.
The goal is to visualize **the top 10 highest mean temperatures** using a **bar chart** and **the lowest mean temperatures** using a **pie chart** for easy comparison.


## 🧩 Dataset Information

* **Source:** Weather dataset (local or open-source)
* **Key Features:**

  * `Date` – Recorded date of observation
  * `City` / `Location` – Name of the place where data was recorded
  * `Temperature` – Recorded temperature (°C)
  * `Humidity` – Percentage of humidity
  * `WindSpeed` – Wind speed measurement
  * `Precipitation` – Amount of rainfall



## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key steps performed in the notebook:

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values and ensured consistent temperature formats.
2. **Aggregation** – Calculated **mean temperature** for each city/location.
3. **Sorting** – Ranked locations by highest and lowest mean temperature.
4. **Visualization & Insights:**

   * 📊 **Bar Chart:** Displayed **Top 10 locations with the highest mean temperature**.
   * 🥧 **Pie Chart:** Showed **lowest mean temperature distribution** among cities.


## 💡 Key Insights

* Identified the **top 10 hottest locations** based on mean temperature.
* Highlighted **cities with the lowest average temperatures** through a pie chart.
* The visualizations make it easier to compare climatic differences between locations.
* Helps in understanding **regional weather variations** and **temperature trends**.



## 🧠 Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 🐍
* **Libraries:**

  * `pandas` – Data cleaning and aggregation
  * `matplotlib` – Visualization (bar & pie charts)
  * `numpy` – Numerical operations


## 📈 Visualizations

* **Bar Chart** – Top 10 highest mean temperatures
* **Pie Chart** – Lowest mean temperature distribution



## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add **line charts** to show monthly temperature trends.
* Compare **humidity and rainfall** patterns with temperature changes.
* Create **interactive dashboards** for temperature comparison across years.
